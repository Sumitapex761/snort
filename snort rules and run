sudo nano /etc/snort/snort.conf

var RULE_PATH /etc/snort/rules
var SO_RULE_PATH /etc/snort/so_rules
var PREPROC_RULE_PATH /etc/snort/preproc_rules


✅ Include only this rule file:
include $RULE_PATH/local.rules

❌ Comment out all other includes:
# include $RULE_PATH/app-detect.rules
# include $RULE_PATH/backdoor.rules
# ...


✅ Fix reputation section:


preprocessor reputation: \
  memcap 500, \
  priority whitelist, \
  nested_ip inner, \
  whitelist /etc/snort/rules/white_list.rules, \
  blacklist /etc/snort/rules/black_list.rules

✍️ STEP 2: Add Custom ICMP Rule (Ping Detection)
sudo nano /etc/snort/rules/local.rules

alert icmp any any -> any any (msg:"ICMP Ping Detected"; sid:1000001; rev:1;)

RUN :- 
sudo snort -i ens36 -u snort -g snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -A console
